  <div class="algorithm">
    <p  style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Imagine you're hosting a galactic space party ðŸŒŒ and you want to arrange the guests (numbers) in order of their cosmic IDs. Quick Sort swoops in like a superhero to help!</p>
    <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Pick a "pivot" - your special space guest ðŸŒŸ.</li>
      <li style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Divide the other guests into two groups: one with guests smaller than the pivot, and one with guests larger than the pivot.</li>
      <li style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Repeat this process for each group until every guest is in the right order.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Let's dive into the code and see Quick Sort in action:</p>
    <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Look at the magic unfold! âœ¨ The cosmic IDs are sorted in ascending order using Quick Sort. It's like arranging the planets in their rightful orbits!</p>
    <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;">Quick Sort, with its divide and conquer strategy, zips through space-time to sort arrays at warp speed. ðŸš€ðŸŒ </p>
